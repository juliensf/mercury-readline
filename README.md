library.

## License

`mercury_readline` is licensed under a simple 2-clause BSD style license. See the
file [COPYING](COPYING) for details.

Keep in mind however, that GNU Readline itself is licensed under the
[GNU General Public License, version 3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).
(This interface should also work with [Editline](https://github.com/troglobit/editline),
which has a less restrictive license.)

## Installation

Check the values in the file [Make.options](Make.options) to see if they agree

    $ make INSTALL_PREFIX=/foo/bar install

causes the library to be installed in the directory `/foo/bar`.
